This is a simple bubble chart drawn on an HTML Canvas element using JavaScript. The chart displays bubbles at certain X and Y coordinates, with the size of the bubble determined by a third value.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply download the code or clone the repository to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

This project requires a modern web browser with support for the HTML canvas element and JavaScript.

### Installing

There is no installation process for this project. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the bubble chart.

## Usage

The chart displays a set of bubbles with X and Y coordinates specified in the `mockData` array. The size of each bubble is determined by a third value in the array.

The chart also includes a set of X and Y axes, with tick marks and labels. The tick marks are spaced at intervals of 20, with the values labeled at each tick mark.

## Customization

To customize the chart, you can adjust the values in the `mockData` array to change the location and size of the bubbles.

You can also adjust the tick mark spacing and labeling by changing the `for` loops that draw the axes.
The `xScale` and `yScale` functions can be adjusted to change the scaling of the chart axes.

The colors and styles of the bubbles and axes can be customized by adjusting the `styles` variable in the `chart.js` file.
